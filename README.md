# AI-Powered Study Buddy

## Project Description
AI-Powered Study Buddy is a simple command-line study assistant that quizzes you on flashcards you provide. It uses spaced repetition logic to help reinforce learning by repeating questions at increasing intervals. This project helps beginners practice Python concepts such as loops, dictionaries, user input, and basic algorithmic thinking.

## Features
- Quiz mode with user-input answers
- Spaced repetition to improve memory retention
- Tracks question state and repetition intervals
- Easy to extend with more flashcards or save progress

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed on your system

### How to Run
1. Download the project files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project folder.
4. Run the script using:
    ```
    python study_buddy.py
    ```
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to answer quiz questions.

## Usage Example

## How It Works
The program quizzes you on preset flashcards.  
When you answer correctly, the flashcard moves to the next spaced repetition interval.  
If answered incorrectly, it resets to be asked again sooner.  
This reinforces learning over time through repetition at increasing time intervals.

## Future Improvements
- Add functionality to save and load progress
- Allow users to add their own flashcards dynamically
- Implement a graphical interface using Tkinter or web-based UI
- Integrate a timer for automatic reminders
